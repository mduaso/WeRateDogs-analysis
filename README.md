About the documents

There are three documents to tackle this project. A Jupyter notebook that comprehends the data gathering; data assessment; data cleaning; and the storage, analysis and visualization. One report that briefly describes the wrangling efforts. And another report that communicates the insights and displays the visualizations produced from the wrangled data.
